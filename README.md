## Well, Hello There! 👋
My name is Janice (aka the Voice of Data) 😊

<!--
**voiceofdata/voiceofdata** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.>

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub. I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst who believes that data doesn't just inform—it tells a story. My job is to give it voice.

🎯 **What I do**  
- Translate business questions into actionable insights  
- Build interactive dashboards (Power BI is my jam)   
- Blend curiosity, logic, and clarity to solve real problems

🛠️ **Tech I use regularly**  
Power BI • SQL • Excel • ServiceNow Reporting 

🌱 **In Progress**  
- Building out my project portfolio  
- Launching [voiceofdata.ca](https://voiceofdata.ca/)  
- Telling better stories with data, one question at a time

Feel free to poke around—more coming soon!
